Either make a new sentiment analysis package or use a preexisting one. 

- goal is to harness the sentiment analysis to package how someone feels through meaningful journaling. (graphical plotting of good vs bad days)
- track what youve done over the course of a month and return to the user what they should continue doing and what they should try to stop doing.
